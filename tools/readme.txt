This is where project specific tools are gonna live as source code. They
can all be compiled with their provided CMake files, or run as-is if they're
not in a compiled language!

Most of this is C, you may see interpreted languages here too! And if you do,
it's more likely going to be something like Lua or Ruby, stuff we use in-house.

If you want to submit changes to these tools or even create new ones, you're
more than welcome to!
