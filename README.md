# Nova

An experimental FPS game inspired by the classics of Halo CE and Halo 2. This is more of a *passion project* than anything. But it stands as one of the most fleshed out projects, both in terms of content and in a more literal sense. This project will include both a singleplayer and multiplayer experience. However, multiplayer will be dealt with **later in development.**

To be blunt, Multiplayer is complicated. But that's for later! This game is planned to follow similar beats to the original CE/2 stories to some degree. But it will keep our original charm. ✨

# Wait, C **and** C++?

Correct! One of our primary dependencies is [Dear ImGui]() which is written mostly in C++. To avoid extra dependencies, we just use both languages. There's still mostly **C** present in the codebase, but interactions with imgui usually happen in **C++** files.

The assets for this project, like all other projects, are proprietary. All artwork, music, characters, dialogue, and other game assets are **not covered** by the license in the repository. These remain the exclusive property of **Lunarwing Games** and may not be copied, modified, or redistributed.
