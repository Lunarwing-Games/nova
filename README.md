# Nova

An experimental FPS game inspired by the classics of Halo CE and Halo 2. This is more of a *passion project* than anything. But it stands as one of the most fleshed out projects, both in terms of content and in a more literal sense. This project will include both a singleplayer and multiplayer experience. However, multiplayer will be dealt with **later in development.**

To be blunt, Multiplayer is complicated. But that's for later! This game is planned to follow similar beats to the original CE/2 stories to some degree. But it will keep our original charm. ✨

# Wait, C?

C. Not C++, not C#, not some partially mainstream language like Rust. Good old, infinitely reliable, eternally present... C. This sounds *insane* considering we are actively building and maintaining a C++ framework, but that's part of the charm. This project lives in its own little ecosystem of C and questionable uses of undefined behavior. Will this come back to haunt us years down the line? I sure hope it won't!

To be more accurate: it's a creative challenge, a return to form, in a way. It's about **absolute control**, making something new and fresh with a language that's been around since the early 1970s.
